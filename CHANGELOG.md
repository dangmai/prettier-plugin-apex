# Unreleased

- Fix dangling comments in `continue`/`break`/`return` statements not getting printed ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1946)).
- Fix trailing empty line not printed after ignored nodes in triggers/anonymous blocks ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1892)).

# 2.2.5

- Fix ignored SOQL nodes formatted to invalid Apex code in certain situations ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1891)).
- Fix trailing empty line not printed after ignored nodes ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1892)).

# 2.2.4

- Fix comment misidentified as the last trailing comment in source code ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1836))

# 2.2.3

- Fix Linux native executables having low stack depth ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1809), [issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1733)).
- Fix Linux native executables not being able to run in macOS Docker on Apple Silicon ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1822)).
- Fix duplicate newlines after last trailing comment in document ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1777)).

# 2.2.2

- Fix native executable not usable in NixOS Linux environment ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1706)).

# 2.2.1

- Fix native executable not spawned correctly in path with special characters ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1702)).

# 2.2.0

- Native parsing is now the default parser for supported platforms, with fallback to Java parser for unsupported platforms.
- Support Apex AST Serializer native executable for macOS x64.
- Improve native executable performance by utilizing Profile-Guided Optimization.
- Improve parsing performance by directly serializing object references.
- Improve parsing performance by using one-pass Depth-First Search to enrich AST.

## Breaking Changes

- Apex AST Serializer no longer supports outputting XML, or object references.
  This reduces code paths that are not absolutely necessary for the operation of Prettier Apex,
  leading to performance increases and binary size reduction.
  This should not affect end users' experience with Prettier Apex,
  but if you are using Apex AST Serializer directly,
  the `-i` and `-f` flags have been removed.
- The `install-apex-executables` command is removed,
  since native executables are now distributed as optional dependencies to the main package.

# 2.1.5

- Fix Windows application not being able to get output from parser when `DEBUG` environment variable is set ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1513)).
- Improving parsing performance - thanks to @lukecotter for their contribution!

# 2.1.4

## Internal Changes

- Fix `install-apex-executables` script hanging unnecessarily ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1368)).
- Prettier Apex should now throw an error with details when it fails to call Apex AST Serializer executable.
- NPM package tests are now run on multiple platforms to catch any platform-dependent regressions.
- Use relative path to binary files to avoid issues with special characters in Windows path.

# 2.1.3

- Spawn Apex AST Serializer server process with shell turned on (missed in `v2.1.2`).
  Thanks to @mwcm for their contribution!

# 2.1.2

- Spawn Apex AST Serializer process with shell turned on.
  This is a workaround for new version of NodeJS that disallows calling `.bat` file without this option.
  See this [blog post](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/april-2024-security-releases-2) for more details
  ([issue](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex/issues/1347)).
  Thanks to @mwcm for their contribution!
